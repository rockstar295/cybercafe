Here’s a clear README explanation for your website:

I checked the live site — it’s a “Mini CyberChef”-style tool that lets users perform encode / decode / encrypt / decrypt operations in the browser.

📌 Project Title

Mini CyberChef – Encryption & Decryption Web Tool

🚀 Live Demo

👉 https://rockstar295.github.io/cybercafe/

📜 What is this?

This is a simple web-based encryption and decryption tool inspired by the popular CyberChef web application — a “Cyber Swiss Army Knife” for data manipulation. It runs completely in the browser and lets users encode, decode, encrypt, and decrypt text using different algorithms / transformations.

This project was created for educational purposes — to demonstrate how common cryptographic and encoding operations work in real time.

🧰 Features

The tool currently supports:

✔ Caesar Cipher – basic text shift cipher
✔ ROT13 – simple rotation by 13 characters
✔ Base64 Encode / Decode – text ↔ Base64 conversion
✔ Hex Encode / Decode – text ↔ hexadecimal conversion
✔ URL Encode / Decode – for URLs and web parameters
✔ XOR Encryption – simple XOR with key
✔ Atbash Cipher – substitution cipher
✔ AES-like (Demo) – simple demo encryption function

All operations run locally in the browser — your data and keys are never sent to a server.

🛠️ How To Use

Open the website.

Enter text in the Input box.

Choose an operation from the dropdown.

Enter a key/shift if required (e.g., for Caesar or XOR).

Click Run.

The output shows results instantly.

🧠 How It Works

Client-side processing: All transformations happen in JavaScript in your browser — no backend or database.

Interactive UI: Users can quickly switch between different operations.

Instant results: No page reload — just immediate text transformation.

⚠️ Notes

This is not a secure cryptographic application for real sensitive data.

AES-like demo is simplified and educational only.
